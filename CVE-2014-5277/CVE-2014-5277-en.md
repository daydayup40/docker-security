##CVE-2014-5277   fallback to HTTP when HTTPS connections to the registry fail 



##Category  
downgrade attack 
man-in-the-middle attack


##Description  
The Docker engine and the Python module, docker-py, first attempt  to contact the registry using HTTPS. If that attempt fails, they will fall back to using in-the-clear HTTP connections. This facilitates the possibility of a downgrade attack by allowing attackers to force registry connections into using insecure communications to transmit authentication and image data.
